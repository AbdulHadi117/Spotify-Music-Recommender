- **Token Management:** Handles token refresh and session management to maintain user authentication.
- **Error Handling:** Includes error handling for API calls and user input validation.

## Setup

1. **Create a Spotify Developer Account:**
   - Register an application to obtain a Client ID and Client Secret.

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following content:
  
     ```.env
     CLIENT_ID=<your_spotify_client_id>
     CLIENT_SECRET=<your_spotify_client_secret>
     REDIRECT_URI=<your_redirect_uri>
     FLASK_SECRET_KEY=<your_flask_secret_key>
     ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**
   - Run the following command to install the necessary Python packages:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   - Start the Flask web server with:

     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

## Usage
